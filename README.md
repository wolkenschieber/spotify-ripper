# libspotify's deprecation

According to the [Libspotify SDK Resources](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#libspotify-and-cocoalibspotify-downloads) `libspotify` has been considered deprecated since 2015 and will be shut down in 2017.

The library is no longer available for download and Spotify doesn't grant anymore api keys. 

Ultimately this means, that this project come to an end.

**Farewell**
